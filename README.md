# Build a  Wikipedia Viewer

This is the fifth project for Free Code Camp's Front-End certificate.

Completed On: 31 March 2016  
Last Updated: 08 May 2017

## Objectives

Build an app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/wGqEga/.

**Rule #1**: Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.

**Rule #2**: Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

## User Stories

- I can search Wikipedia entries in a search box and see the resulting Wikipedia entries.
- I can click a button to see a random Wikipedia entry.

## Hints

- #1: Here's a URL you can use to get a random Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random.
- #2: Here's an entry on using Wikipedia's API: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page.
- #3: Use this link to experiment with Wikipedia's API.
